# React Colorpicker

![Color Picker](color-picker.gif)

This color picker was a fun project to begin with, but this revamp was more fun and better all around.  We used React Components to build the app, and mobx to store the state and functions.  It is responsive to movements of each input, and shows the correct syntax depending on the alpha setting.  Reusable for custom web apps that pertain to color choices.
